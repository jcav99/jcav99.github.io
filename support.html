    <h1>Scams through direct messages</h1>
    <p>A good amount of the time, scammers may attempt to access you with the direct message feature that steam has.  They will often contact unsuspecting users, and give them reasons to trade for items.  This typically results in items being stolen, or accounts being compromised.</p>
    <br>
    <h2>To avoid having this happen to you, make sure you remember these steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If a person in the direct messages is claiming to be steam support, <em>it is a scam.</em>  Steam support will never contact you through direct messages.</li>
        <li>Do research on a website if you feel uncomfortable about it.  It never hurts to be too safe.</li>
        <li>Just because somebody you know sent the message doesn't make it safe. You don't if if they are trying to trick you, or if their account got hacked.</li>
    </ol>
    <br>
    <p>There are also some ways to prepare for an event like this, so that in any event where you might be the target of a scam, your account will be extra safe.  There are many different ways to help keep your account safe, such as using the steam mobile app to enable steam guard, making it so that you need your phone in order to log in to your account.  This is also necessary in order to do trading on steam.</p>

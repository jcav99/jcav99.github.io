    <h1>Scams through direct messages</h1>
    <p>A good amount of the time, scammers may attempt to access you with the direct message feature that steam has.  They will often contact unsuspecting users, and give them reasons to trade for items.  This typically results in items being stolen, or accounts being compromised.</p>
    <h2>To avoid having this happen to you, make sure you remember these steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>If a person in the direct messages is claiming to be steam support, <em>it is a scam.</em>  Steam support will never contact you through direct messages.</li>
        <li></li>
    </ol>

    <h1>Which webistes are safe</h1>
    <p>With all of these dangerous websites and scamming methods, it is not unusual to try and avoid any website for steam possible.  However, steam's websites are often very useful, and can be used in order to trade and interact with others.  One of my favortite games on steam, Team Fortress 2, has tons of websites that help with things like trading.  Some websites that I use are listed below.</p>
    <div class="websitetable">
        <a href="https://scrap.tf" target="_blank" class="website">scrap.tf</a>
        <p class="description">Scrap.tf is an automated trading site which can be used to trade tf2 items with bots.  It is particularly useful if you want to do some quick trading and don't want to spend tons of time negotiating for a cheaper price.</p>
        <a href="https://backpack.tf" target="_blank" class="website">backpack.tf</a>
        <p class="description">Backpack.tf is a trading site which allows you to connect with people easily.  It is a lot bigger than scrap.tf, but also more complicated.  Should be used once you become more experienced in trading.</p>
        <p class="website">Steam Community Market</p>
        <p class="description">One of the best ways to exchange items is through a system set up on steam itself, called the steam community market.  The SCM allows you to exchange items from numerous games in exchange for funds in your steam wallet, which can be used to buy different items or even games from the steam store. <br> NOTE: After purchasing items from the SCM, they will not be tradeable for one week.  Keep this in mind if you are interested in getting into trading.</p>

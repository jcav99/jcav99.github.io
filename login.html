    <h1>Logging into websites with Steam</h1>
    <p class="loginintro">A lot of the times, if you are trying to access data from steam on certain websites, you will run into login prompts that look something like the one on the right.  While these usually do not take things like your password or permissions to buy or take stuff, some scammers might create websites with fake versions of these logins in order to trick users into giving them permissions without realizing.  There are ways to tell the difference between these real and fake logins, and I will show them here.</p>
    <img src="images/login.png" alt="Login Page" class="RealLogin">
    <p class="loginintro">Take a look at the right side of the login image.  You will notice some bullet points explaining what happens to your information if you log in with steam.  Pay close attention to these bullet points, as every legitimate website will have them.  If a site is missing one of these bullet points, you should stay on edge and avoid it.</p>
    <h2>Remember: Even if nothing seems off about logging in, do your research and ask others if it is legit.  <em>It's never a bad thing to double check.</em></h2>
